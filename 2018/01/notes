Day 1 is simple as usual, took a bit to get back into the swing of scala though.

Part 1 is just summing the values

Part 2 is checking for states that we have already seen. scanLeft and find
should handle this in O(n). Broadly though what we want is

val seenFreqs = Set(0)
val seen = false
val cycledFreqs = cycle(frequencies)
val curFreq = 0
while !seen:
  curFreq += cycledFreqs.next
  seen = seenFreqs(curFreq)
  seenFreqs = seenFreqs + curFreq
