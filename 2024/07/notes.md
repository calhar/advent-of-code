Advent of Code 2024 day 7
=========================

Skipping ahead slightly because I'm playing catch up and I can't be bothered to deal with day 6 part 2 right now.
Relatively straight forward dfs/bfs here, naturally go doesn't come with a nice built in stack so actually did the
recursive implementation for once.  
Had to undo my sense checking logic in part 2 because of the new operator.
Everything is definitely still a bit ugly and crap -- definitely not idiomatic go here.
