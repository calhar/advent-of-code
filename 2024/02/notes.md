Advent of Code 2024 Day 2
=========================

Returning to this now that I'm on holiday and don't have other distractions. Slices are still weird.
Not happy with:
1. How I calculated whether the list is increasing or decreasing. Feels like it shouldn't need O(n).
2. Initial solution for problem 2 is terrible and definitely doesn't need testing the report with every
  value removed. Will improve to be O(n)
