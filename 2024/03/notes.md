Fairly straightforward solve using regex to extract all the commands. Not thrilled about
the solve for part 2 -- just adding in alternation for `do()` and `don't()`. But it works.

The iteration could definitely be nicer as well, I should probably start experimenting
with the `yield` keyword for retrieving data from STDIN
