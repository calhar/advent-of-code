Nothing really to say about these problems. If you know this article exists
then hex grids are very simple

Implementation wise, although representing the cube coordinates as a (x, y, z)
tuple seemed the obvious thing to do, having to do math.abs(point._1),
math.abs(point._2), math.abs(point._3), seems quite ugly compared to the
alternative of point.map(math.abs(_)) if the coordinates were stored in some
sequence instead

If I were to solve it without knowing about the many, very good articles on hex
grids that exist, I would have gone for something like:

3 axis coordinate system corresponding to north, northeast, northwest
Process the list to get the distance travelled along these axes
Compute the true distance based on those
