Annoyingly simple following yesterdays. Hoped the puzzles were going to start
getting more complex. Presumably these generators will be used in a future
puzzle.

I'll have a look for ways to optimise, but I'm not expecting much.
Minor improvement from bitwise and instead of modulo for checking values
divisible by 4 and 8.

Other things to do, flesh out to extend from Iterator[Int]
