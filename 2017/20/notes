Another really fun challenge, originally for part 1 I just found the positions
at step 1billion. But given that S = 1/2*a*t^2 + v*t + p, as we approach
infinite time, acceleration is the dominant factor for the distance from
(0,0,0). As a result we can take the particles with the minimum acceleration,
and in the instance that we have multiple minimums, find the location at
some large step. Significantly reducing the amount of work we must do.

Part 2, can be handled in two ways, although one is a little untidy.
One way is to move through each step for the simulation, finding collisions and
removing them as you go. The problem here is that it's unclear at any given step
iteration how many particles are still on collision courses.

The second way is how I have implemented it, finding the root of the equation
describing the distance between particles at any given time. A positive root at
time t is a valid collision. Compute the collisions between every pair of
particles and group collisions by time
We step through the collision groups, removing invalid collisions and then
applying the collision to the remaining particles. Repeat until you have no more
collision groups.
