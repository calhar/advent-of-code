The obvious if you know about it solution to this is the fairly simple
union-find algorithm. However, without knowing what part 2 would entail I
thought it prudent to instead keep all of the data in a map of node -> links
and operate on that instead.

As it turned out, using union-find part 1 and 2 could be trivially written like
so

(0 until links.length).map(root(unions, _)).count(0)
(0 until links.length).map(root(unions, _)).toSet.size

I'll implement it properly eventually
