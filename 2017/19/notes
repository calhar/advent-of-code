An enjoyable puzzle. The solution is rather simple conceptually, so I took the
opportunity to write some probably terrible code as I experimented with some
features I've not yet tried like implicit classes.

My solution makes a few different (probably terrible assumptions), that corners
are always marked with '+' and never a letter, and that a '+' always has 2
branching paths.

The newSym match is really messy and I'm unpleased in general with the traverse
function, I'll have a look at refactoring it tomorrow.
