I think the main reason that my solution for problem 2 ended up relatively ugly
here is due to trying to get the proper n*(n-1)/2 runtime rather than n*(n-1)
from comparing every element with every other element.

I really need to get better about thinking in terms of elegant sequence
manipulations rather than trying to efficiently recurse my way through the
problem
